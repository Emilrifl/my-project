## Hi! My name is Emil, Iâ€™m 14 years old and an 8th-grade student. In my free time, I love playing Dota 2 â€” especially fast-paced team battles and creative strategies. Right now, Iâ€™m diving into Python: building Discord and Telegram bots to automate tasks or just have fun. For example, I made a bot that sends memes on command or reminds about homework! ðŸš€ My goal is to master programming basics like a PRO and create advanced projects â€” maybe even a mini-game or a useful AI tool. When Iâ€™m not coding, I play soccer with classmates or watch Python tutorials on YouTube. ðŸ’»âš¡ðŸŽ®
